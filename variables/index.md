# Variables

## Defination
variable is the name of memory location location where data is stored

## Rules to write vairiables

1. Variables are case sensitive
2. 1st character is alphabet or '_'
3. no comma/black space
4. No other symbol other than '_'

## Data types (bytes) of variables
|     Data types        |      size in Bytes     |
|-----------------------| -----------------------| 
| char or singed char   |            1           | 
| unsigned char         |            1           | 
| float                  |           4           |
| double                |            8           |
| long double           | at least 10, usuablly 12 or 16 |
| int or signed int     | at least 2, usually 4   |
| unsigned int          | at least 2, usually 4   |
| short int or unsigned short int|   2 usually     |
| signed short int      |            2           |
| long int               | at least 4, usually 8 |
| unsigned long int     | at least 4             |
| long long int         | at least 8             |
| unsigned long long int | at least 8             |


## Different types of constants variables

If a variable's value did not change, it is fixed than its called  **constants variables**.

If a constants variables hold integer values (does not include floating point number) is called **integer constants**.

If a constants variables hold floating point number is called **Real or Floating point constants**

If a contants variable hold character such as alpha bet and different types of character ('@','#') is called **character constants variable**.

-----------------------------------
**Important: There is 32 keywords (such as return, int, enum, register, void) in C programming. We cannot use this keywords as variable**
